I'm not even sure if I have the legal rights to all of the code because significant chunks are copied and pasted(original sources generally included next to copy-pasted chunks of code, for documentation purposes). If I have the rights to the code, or chunks of the code, they are under WTFPL. The full text of WTFPL is as follows.
